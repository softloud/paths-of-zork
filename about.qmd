## Why does this exist? 

This is how I am relaxing at the moment. 

There's something about the mix of graph plotting and text-based adventure gameplay that I am finding very soothing at the moment. I make no commitments to updates or completeness; this is a hobby project I am making to relax, just for me. If other people get something out of it, that's a bonus. 

I enjoy watching the graphs populate as I play, and can never stop tweaking to make improvements to the visualisation tool.

## How is this made?

A blog using Quarto's slate theme. Visualisations created using a combination of R packages:

package | purpose 
---|---------
tidyverse | workhouse datasci toolkit
tidygraph | transform dataframe to ggraph input
ggraph | plots ggraph
gganimate | when I get to animation

> todo: add links

### Why R?

I wanted to be able to plot graphs with the customisation options of ggplot.

## I have been in love with graphs for many years

At some point will write up with links to that slide deck from my abstract algebra work, and the paper. 

## Me and text-based adventure games

My love of this genre goes deep. Things I should nostalgia about at some point

- Lone Wolf RPG choose your own adventure
- Sierra Online games of the mid eightes to early nineties
- fantasy and scifi novels

Point is, I'm primed to fall in love with Zork. 


## From the depths of solitude

I am spending time exploring where I arrive when I'm intentionally spending time in solitude. Been listening to things like Solo: The Single Person's Guide to Living a Remarkable Life. 

I'm in early career, still counting on one hand years since I submitted my doctorate; and this was a second career, so I am older than most graduates. It's hard fought that finally I love my job, my neighbourhood, my city, my lifestyle. I decided to open up lots of space in my life to see what I'd do with solitude. I felt like I'd lost creative spark towards the end of my doctorate. So, I decided to remove all expectation of professional betterment in my spare time and just see what I felt like doing. 

This is what I end up doing on weekends. All week, I've looked forward to coming home to do this. Go figure.
