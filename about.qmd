## Why does this exist? 

This is how I am relaxing at the moment. There's something about the mix of graph plotting and text-based adventure gameplay that I am finding very soothing at the moment. I make no commitments to updates or completeness; this is a hobby project I am making to relax, for me. If other people get something out of it, that's a bonus. 

## I have been in love with graphs for many years

## From the depths of solitude

I am spending time exploring where I arrive when I'm intentionally spending time in solitude. This is what I end up doing with my time. Go figure.
